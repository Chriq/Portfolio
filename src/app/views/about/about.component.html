        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Games are a frontier we've only <i>just</i> begun to tap.</h3>
        </div>

            Video games as an art form have had an incredible trajectory. From humble beginnings, they have branched in such a wide variety of directions and pushed well beyond the scope anyone could have predicted. To me, video games offer an engaging and interactive way to tell stories and share experiences in ways never possible before.

            This medium has an abundance of untapped potential: potential to tell incredible stories and craft unforgettable experiences. Seeing that potential come to fruition in my favortite games like <i>Wanderstop</i>, <i>Outer Wilds</i>, <i>OneShot</i>, and many others only fuels my motivation to pursue the craft.

            All creative endeavors and creative people require balance, and I enjoy many activities outside of making games! I love to cook, especially experimenting with new and complex recipes. I'm an avid musical composer (yes, for game sountracks, but also just for myself!) I also enjoy exploring different neighborhoods in Richmond, frequenting local coffee shops, bookstores, and museums.
